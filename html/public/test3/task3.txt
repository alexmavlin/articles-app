There is a list of articles in markdown format (and article images associated). 
Write a PHP output of a simple table with a list of all articles on the screen. In the table there is a possibility to open the article editor (with SAVE CHANGES functionality), it is opened by the Edit button.

'Save changes' writes to audit.log file (in the root of the project) the metrics of text modifiability:
- how many words were added/removed in this edit;
- whether tables were added (and how many);
- whether pictures were added (and how many).

Present the solution as a docker container. At the moment of launching the container, a script converting article *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png images into webp format (with substitution of the url of the image) is triggered inside the container.

Don not forget to tell how much time was spent on the test task.

Thank you.
